# DiuGym Registration System - Setup Instructions

This registration system is built following the class practice code structure from the `Rafarance` folder.

## Prerequisites
- XAMPP installed and running
- Apache and MySQL services started in XAMPP Control Panel

## Database Setup

### Method 1: Using phpMyAdmin (Recommended for beginners)
1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Click on "Import" tab
3. Click "Choose File" and select `database_setup.sql` from the WEP folder
4. Click "Go" to execute the SQL

### Method 2: Using MySQL Command Line
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Click "Shell" button
3. Run: `mysql -u root -p`
4. Press Enter (no password by default)
5. Run: `source C:/xampp/htdocs/WEP/database_setup.sql`

### Method 3: Manual Setup
1. Open phpMyAdmin
2. Create a new database named `diugym_db`
3. Select the database
4. Go to SQL tab and paste the contents of `database_setup.sql`
5. Click "Go"

## File Structure

```
WEP/
├── backend/
│   ├── connection.php          # Database connection (similar to Rafarance/connection.php)
│   ├── register_user.php       # Registration handler (similar to Rafarance/code.php)
│   └── login_user.php          # Login handler
├── register.html               # Registration form (similar to Rafarance/index.php)
├── login.html                  # Login form
├── index.html                  # Main page
└── database_setup.sql          # Database setup file (similar to Rafarance/sql.txt)
```

## How It Works

Following the same pattern as your class practice code:

1. **Database Connection** (`backend/connection.php`)
   - Connects to MySQL database `diugym_db`
   - Similar to `Rafarance/connection.php`

2. **Registration Process** (`register.html` → `backend/register_user.php`)
   - User fills the registration form
   - Form submits to `backend/register_user.php` (like `Rafarance/index.php` → `code.php`)
   - Data is validated and inserted into `users` table
   - Password is hashed for security
   - Redirects to login page on success

3. **Login Process** (`login.html` → `backend/login_user.php`)
   - User fills login form
   - Credentials are verified against database
   - Session is created for logged-in user
   - Redirects to home page on success

## Testing the System

1. Make sure XAMPP is running with Apache and MySQL services started
2. Run the database setup (see Database Setup section above)
3. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost/WEP/register.html`
4. Fill in the registration form and submit
5. You should be redirected to login page with a success message
6. Login with your credentials
7. You should be redirected to the home page

## Database Table Structure

The `users` table has the following columns:
- `id`: Auto-increment primary key
- `fullname`: User's full name (VARCHAR 100)
- `email`: User's email (VARCHAR 100, UNIQUE)
- `phone`: User's phone number (VARCHAR 20)
- `password`: Hashed password (VARCHAR 255)
- `created_at`: Timestamp of registration

## Security Features

1. **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using PHP's `password_hash()` function
2. **Email Uniqueness**: Checks if email already exists before registration
3. **Session Management**: User sessions are created upon successful login
4. **Input Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Connection failed" error
**Solution**: Make sure MySQL service is running in XAMPP Control Panel

### Issue: "Table doesn't exist" error
**Solution**: Run the database setup SQL file using one of the methods above

### Issue: Form submits but nothing happens
**Solution**: Check if Apache service is running and PHP is working by visiting `http://localhost`

### Issue: "Email already exists" error
**Solution**: This means you're trying to register with an email that's already in the database. Use a different email or delete the existing record from phpMyAdmin.

## Next Steps

You can extend this system by:
1. Adding a "Forgot Password" feature
2. Creating a user dashboard
3. Adding email verification
4. Implementing "Remember Me" functionality
5. Adding user profile management
